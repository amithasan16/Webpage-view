        <h1><span class="color-fact">CSE</span> WORLD!</h1>
        <p>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.In addition to general Computer Engineering degrees, universities and colleges also offer different specialisations or subdisciplines if you want to narrow down your focus. <h2>Here are a few examples:</h2>
<ul>
           <li>Hardware Systems</li>
           <li>Distributed Computing</li>
            <li>Robotics and Cybernetics</li>
            <li>Embedded Systems</li>
            <li>Computer Graphics and Visualisation</li>
            <li>Medical Image Computing</li>
           <li> Computer and Network Security</li> </ul>
      <h2>CS Engineer</h2> A computer systems engineer is a professional who is responsible for utilising their knowledge of programming, computer science, principles of mathematics in determining how technology is being used to fulfill the personal and professional requirements of users.Computer Engineering students learn how to develop, prototype, and test microchips, circuits, processors, conductors and any other component used in computer devices or systems </p>

        <h1> <span class="color-fact2">Master Code</span> </h1>
        <p>Coding is how humans are able to talk with computers. Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to perform using a computer programming language. Programming languages, like JavaSctipt, Java, C/C++, or Python, act as the translator between humans and machinesYou'll discover different languages, frameworks, libraries, inventions and conventions.One technology often requires knowledge of another one, and everything seems to be interconnected and intertwined.With new technologies coming out often in such a fast paced and ever-changing industry, it can quickly get confusing for beginner coders.When learning how to code, instead of just focusing on learning a specific technology, it can also help to learn the foundations – the building blocks – and to peel back the layers of abstraction to get to know the underlying principles that all these technologies have in common.</p>       
            <h2>What is coding?</h2>
        <p>Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.</p>

            <h2>About C++||</h2>
        <p>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.Our C++ programming tutorial will guide you to learn C++ programming one step at a time.C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[11] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p>

            <h2>About Java||</h2>
        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers</p>
